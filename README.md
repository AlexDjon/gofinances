## :page_with_curl: About
This repository contains a REST API made with Node.js as back-end, and an application in ReactJS as a front-end, both using TypeScript.

This is the GoFinances application, for managing transactions in which the user is able to access their total balance, as well as all the amount already made in deposit and withdrawal. Users can also import transactions by importing a CSV file.
